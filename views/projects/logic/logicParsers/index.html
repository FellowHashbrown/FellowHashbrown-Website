                PyLogic was the project i began with. i am most experienced in python (relative to java, javascript, c++, etc.) so that's why i started there. <br>
                i translated it into java and then javascript (collaborating with <a href="https://github.com/fifiinart" class="link">fifiinart</a> on that one) <br>
                here is the <a href="https://github.com/FellowHashbrown/PyLogic" class="link">github</a> link <br>
                i have also written an <a href="/api#logic" class="link">API</a> for it you can use for any projects you wish to use it on

                after writing PyLogic, i translated it into java and put it into an android app which i have available from the downloads page.
                the functions are similar to PyLogic as well to reduce confusion among logic parsers. <br>
